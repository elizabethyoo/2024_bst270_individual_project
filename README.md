# 2024 BST270 individual project 
This repository contains my attempt to reproduce the figures in FiveThirtyEight's article [How Americans Like Their Steak](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-americans-like-their-steak/)

# Setting up the environment
This project is written in R and uses widely used packages -- `knitr`, `tidyverse`, and `data.table.` If you do not already have these packages installed, use the command `install.packages("package-name-here")` to install them before running the reproduction attempt. 

# Project Structure 
The reproduction attempt is contained in `./code`
